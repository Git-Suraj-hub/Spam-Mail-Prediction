## 🚀 Features

* 📥 **User Input**: Enter car details like name, model, fuel type, and kilometers.
* ⚙️ **Preprocessing**: Applies encoding and scaling using saved transformers.
* 📈 **Price Prediction**: Predicts car price using a trained regression model.
* 🎯 **Real-Time Output**: Instant price estimates displayed on the app.
* 🧠 **Model Logic**: Based on a Linear Regression model trained on historical data.
