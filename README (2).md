This is a machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts the price of a used car based on various features like model, brand, fuel type, kilometers driven, etc.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 Predicts car prices based on input features.
- 📈 Uses a trained machine learning model (`trained_model.sav`).
- 🧠 Streamlit interface for interactive predictions.
- 🌙 Dark mode enabled by default.
